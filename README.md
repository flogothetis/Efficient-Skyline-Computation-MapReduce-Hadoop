# Efficient-Skyline-Computation-MapReduce-Hadoop
Skyline queries are useful for finding interesting tuples from a large data set according to multiple criteria. The sizes of
data sets are constantly increasing and the architecture of back-ends are switching from single-node environments to
non-conventional paradigms like MapReduce. Despite the usefulness of skyline queries, existing works on skyline computation in
MapReduce do not take full advantage of parallelism but still run significant parts serially. In this project,
we implement a novel approach to compute skylines efficiently in MapReduce.
